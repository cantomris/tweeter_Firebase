# Tweeter App (A Twitter clone)

Apart from the standard 'Vue' projects, in this project the 'state' layer is designed over the 'object relational mapping (ORM)' by using object oriented programming paradigms.

This method is used to ensure that the weight is given to the model part, which is in accordance with the 'Model View' logic used in object oriented programming.

This app is made for learning and entertainment purposes and it is still under development.
